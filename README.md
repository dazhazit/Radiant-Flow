# Radiant-Flow
Radiant Flow Graph. A visual anything environment. Map your mind, Flow your program or control a nuclear power station.

A while back I bacame interested in AI and better ways of implementing and controlling it rather than our dry old boring text interface and Pytorch. I actually hate python as I've never agreed with the use of indentatation to indicate block level due to differences in text editors and how they treat the humble tab. Yet scientist etc... seem to worship it when in fact it isn't actually that more capable than other programming languages in the handling of mathematical concepts no matter what the phanbouys seem to harp on with the "But.. But... But... It's capable of this" blah blah. Thusly I'm a massive fan of the enclosing brace and I guess they've never heard of tensorflow.JS

Being also a fan of Blender and a little bit of an expert in procedural shaders I am also a big fan of the node based flow graph.
We'll see how this goes but the more I have though about potential uses. The larger and more diverse my thinking has become.

So let us start in my conquest of the world with an ultra flexible flow graph. I've tried many and none of them seem to be quite right visually or programmatically. So this is my own home grown, hand rolled one.
